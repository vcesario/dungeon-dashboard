Great ‚Äî you're aiming for a meaningful and well-structured analysis. Here's a breakdown of **the best chart types** for each category and metric, with reasons:

---

## üó∫Ô∏è **Exploration**

### 1. **Unique Rooms Entered / Total Rooms**

* **Chart Type:** **Violin Plot or BoxPlot** per Player Profile
* **Why:** Shows exploration efficiency *and* distribution. Reveals if some players skip content or fully explore.
* **Alt:** Heatmap of exploration ratio per profile √ó level could also work.

### 2. **LocksOpened / TotalLocks**

* **Chart Type:** **BoxPlot**
* **Why:** Direct ratio per run (0‚Äì1 range), great for compact comparison across profiles or levels.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Combat**

### 3. **Enemies Killed vs Total Enemies**

* **Chart Type:** **Stacked Bar Chart** (Killed vs Remaining) or **Dot Plot of Kill Rate**
* **Why:** You can normalize to show kill ratio, or stack to compare raw numbers.

### 4. **Max Combo**

* **Chart Type:** **BoxPlot or Histogram** per profile
* **Why:** Shows skill spike variability ‚Äî useful for identifying combat proficiency.

### 5. **Total Deaths vs Total Attempts**

* **Chart Type:** **Scatter Plot** (X: Attempts, Y: Deaths), with Profile color
* **Why:** Identifies reckless vs cautious behavior. Could also compute and color by death rate.

---

## üß© **Quests**

### 6. **Completed Quests per Category (Immersion, etc.)**

* **Chart Type:** **Stacked Bar Chart** per Player Profile
* **Why:** Shows which player types lean into which categories.

### 7. **Completed Quests per Subcategory**

* **Chart Type:** **Grouped Bar Chart** or **Radar Chart** (per profile)
* **Why:** Allows finer analysis of player behavior toward specific quest types.

---

## ‚ö° **Efficiency**

### 8. **CompletedQuests vs TimeToFinish**

* **Chart Type:** **Scatter Plot**

  * X: TimeToFinish
  * Y: CompletedQuests
  * Color/shape by profile
* **Why:** Clear way to spot who‚Äôs efficient vs who‚Äôs slow or ineffective.

### 9. **UniqueRoomsEntered vs TimeToFinish**

* **Chart Type:** **Scatter Plot**
* **Why:** Highlights fast explorers vs slow methodical players. Add regression lines per profile if needed.

### 10. **TotalDeaths vs TimeToFinish**

* **Chart Type:** **Scatter Plot**
* **Why:** Explore the risk/duration correlation. Deadlier runs might be shorter or longer depending on approach.

---

## Bonus: Heatmap Matrix

If you want a **summary chart** of efficiency metrics across profiles:

* **Chart Type:** **Heatmap Matrix**

  * Rows: Player profiles
  * Columns: Metrics (Avg. deaths, kill ratio, locks opened, quests completed, etc.)
  * Cells: Scaled z-scores or normalized values

Let me know if you'd like D3/React implementations or mockups for any of these.
